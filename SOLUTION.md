# Part 2: Implement device list UI

Honestly, I didn't integrate any of the listed frontend solutions, mentioned in the proposal. But it doesn't mean, I
didn't explore them ðŸ˜‹.

It would be very interesting to talk more again and discuss libraries. Maybe it's just my impression from the task, but
looks like you don't need all that libraries, and they don't work with each other.

Didn't have time to try a bonus login page.
